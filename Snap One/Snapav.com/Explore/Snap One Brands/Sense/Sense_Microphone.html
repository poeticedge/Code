All Sense products currently operating in the 600Mhz spectrum band will be discontinued as of October 13, 2018, and will not be compatible with devices operating in the 500Mhz spectrum band. Starting July 13, 2020, FCC regulations will prohibit use of the 600MHz band of the UHF spectrum by consumer devices. <a href="/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/attachments/documents/MicsMixers/SupportDocuments/180731_Sense_microphones_support_doc_RB.pdf" target="_blank">Learn more about affected SKUs >></a></span>
