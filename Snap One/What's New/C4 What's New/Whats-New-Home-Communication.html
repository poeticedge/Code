          <p>
            Using the Control4 OS 3 apps for iOS and Android, Intercom Anywhere
            makes mobile phones part of the Control4 Intercom user experience.
            Homeowners can always see who is at the front door – and have a new
            way to stay connected with their family and control their home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Built into the Control4 OS 3 app, Intercom Anywhere quickly notifies
            homeowners when someone rings their Control4 Chime Video Doorbell,
            the DS2 Door Station, or any other supported door station. And, best
            of all, Intercom Anywhere works virtually anywhere in the world.

            Any video doorbell should allow you to use a smartphone to see and
            talk to visitors at the door, but Control4 Intercom Anywhere also
            allows homeowners to control their smart home during an intercom
            call. Two custom-programmed buttons are available to turn on lights,
            unlock the door, open the gate or garage, disarm the alarm, or
            anything else you need when a visitor comes to the door.
