              <h2>SnapAV Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>Effective May 25, 2018</p>
              <h3>I.  Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                  At Wirepath Home Systems, LLC (“SnapAV”), your privacy and the security of your personal data is important to us. The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to provide you with transparency regarding how we collect personal data, why we collect such personal data, and what we do with your personal data. SnapAV primarily sells its products to authorized dealers (the “Dealer(s)”) who then resell our product to the end consumer. For purposes of this Policy, an End User is anyone utilizing a SnapAV Device. This Policy is addressed to both to the End User and Dealer.
              </p>
              <h3>II.  About This Policy</h3>
              <p>
                  This Policy provides essential details relating to your personal data relationship with SnapAV. The Policy applies to your use of the SnapAV website and the websites and microsites of all of our affiliated brands including the SunBriteTV website,  Aisle8 website, Episode website, WattBox website and OvrC website (collectively referred to as the “Sites”), as well as the End User’s use of any SnapAV products including, but not limited to, our Araknis, Autonomic, Episode, Luma, Visualint, WattBox, OvrC, and SunBrite branded products and all associated services and applications that connect to such devices (collectively referred to as the “Devices”).
              </p>
              <p>
                  From time to time, we may develop new products or services. If the new products or services in any way change the way we collect or process your personal data, we will update this Policy accordingly. Unless otherwise stated, all new products or services are subject to this Policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                  By using SnapAV Devices or visiting our Sites, you are accepting SnapAV’s collection of your personal information described in this Policy.  You can always opt-out of allowing SnapAV access to your personal data at any time by contacting SnapAV. Please be advised that opting out of sharing your personal information with us may affect the performance of your Device. If you feel uncomfortable with the way in which SnapAV collects your personal information, you may refrain from using our Devices or accessing our Sites.
              </p>
              <h3>III.  How We Collect Personal Data?</h3>
              <p>
                  If you are an End User, you most likely purchased your SnapAV device from a Dealer. When the Dealer installed the SnapAV Device, they may have shared some personally identifiable information with us such as your name, email address, or IP address. In addition to receiving your personally identifiable information from Dealers and third-party providers, when you visit a SnapAV Site, we may collect information during your visits to Sites through automatic data collection tools such as cookies, web beacons, embedded web links and other commonly used information-gathering tools. We may also collect any information that you directly provide us, or we may also collect information from your use of our Devices.
              </p>
              <h3>IV.  What Personal Data We Collect From You?</h3>
              <p>
                  In order to enable the functionality of your SnapAV Device, the Dealer who installed the Device may collect information about you and your Device and share that information with us.
